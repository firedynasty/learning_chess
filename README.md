Will upload CSV file that will be read on codepen.

I will upload how I use a front-end page to keep track of positions that I can later reference.

After I make the positions, I would like to be able to search not only by single-digit numbers (by the index of the spreadsheet), but to be able to enter the first couple Chess Fen to load the position (so I do not need to type the entire FEN in)
